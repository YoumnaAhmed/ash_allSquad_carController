We are sorry for the mistake that the comments in the video say that "while button is high" it should be written low.
The code's condition is correct that when the button is pressed it gives low reading because we are using pull up resistor 
It's a mistake comment and we have fixed it in the code but we were afraid to record the video and upload it again so we could miss the deadline
